# Haskell Sort Function Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error or bug related to Haskell's `sort` function from the `Data.List` module.  The `sort` function, while generally straightforward, can exhibit unexpected behavior when the input list contains elements of mixed types or when the type of elements doesn't have a defined ordering (doesn't implement the `Ord` typeclass).  The example highlights this issue and provides a solution.

## Problem Description
The `sort` function in Haskell relies on the `Ord` typeclass to determine the order of elements. If you pass a list with elements that are not comparable using the `Ord` instance or if there's a type mismatch, you'll encounter a compile-time error or potentially a runtime exception depending on the context.

## Solution
The solution often involves ensuring that all elements in the list belong to a type that implements the `Ord` typeclass, or creating a custom `Ord` instance for your data type if you have one.
